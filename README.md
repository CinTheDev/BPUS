# BPUS
## Short description
BPUS stands for Bad Piggies Ultimate Sandbox, and is a Fan Game inspired by the original.
My goal for the project is to create a game from scratch in C++, so that means the Game Engine has to be made too.

The Project consists of multiple stages (Currently the project is in Stage 0):

#### Stage 0:
Complete the Game Engine

#### Stage 1:
Put many features from the original in the game

#### Stage 2:
Put own ideas and features in the game, and create a page on Itch.io

## Contribution
For now I want to work alone because the game is in an early state, perhaps I'll change that in the future.

## Used libraries
Another one of my goals is to use as few libraries as possible. Here's the list of all libraries used in the project:
* stb (Image reading)
* glfw (OpenGL)
* glad (OpenGL)
